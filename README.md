18CSL76 FULL LAB PROGRAM
# 1. Implement A* Search algorithm. 
  https://github.com/pratikshakj/LAB-AIML/tree/main/Program1
# 2 Implement AO* Search algorithm
  https://github.com/pratikshakj/LAB-AIML/tree/main/Program2
# 3 For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate theCandidate-Elimination algorithm to output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent withthe training examples
  https://github.com/pratikshakj/LAB-AIML/tree/main/Program3
# 4 Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use anappropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.

# 5 Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Backpropagation algorithm and test the sameusing appropriate data sets. 
  https://github.com/pratikshakj/LAB-AIML/tree/main/Program5
# 6 Write a program to implement the na√Øve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored as a.CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data sets.
